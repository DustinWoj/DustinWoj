- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dustin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of different topics in computer science, especially in the XR realm: Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed reality. I do a lot of my work in Unity3D. I'm hoping to fill this repo with some of my work as well as insights about things I learn along the way.
